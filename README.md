Data Analysis of Clash Royale API using Python

Using the available clash royale api (go to discord server for more details), I've downloaded data of the top 200 players in the world. The dataset contains about 9000 rows of 1 v 1 battles of the top 200 players. Each row consists of the cards of a particular player (8 cards) and of his/her opponents and the winner. 
We have not taken data of draws.
